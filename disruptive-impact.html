        <p class="sec2-subitem-content">According to Shaikh et al. (2024), the practice of Social Media Influencer (SMI) Marketing primarily relies on the concept of social learning theory; it implies that influencers act as guides that prompt their audience and followers  to adopt behaviors and the products associated with them.</p>
        <p class="sec2-subitem-content">This notion is supported by the greater level of trust that those familiar with particular influencers have over more generally known celebrities, demonstrating a relative effectiveness that SMIs possess for marketing (Gräve, 2017). </p>
        <p class="sec2-subitem-content">Although, due to this increase in effectiveness achieved through familiarity, influencers tend to have a more limited reach in comparison to established celebrities as a result of only catering to specific niches. </p>

        <h2 class="section-2-1-q quote">As <span id="h2-bold-italic">detailed by Orencia (2023)</span>, the reach of SMIs, mainly <br> their influence, <span id="h2-bold-italic">is shaped by multiple factors:</span></h2>

        <p class="section-2-1-p"><span id="h2-bold">Relatability</span> refers to the <span id="h2-bold">tendency of consumers to trust SMIs</span> that have, or at least appear to have, similar experiences and interests as they do; and inversely, find it harder to perceive credibility from influencers that they do not consider relatable.</p>

      <div class="grid-item section-2-2l l">
        <p>In 2024, however, with influencer marketing becoming one of the fastest growing industries in the marketing space, influencer's in the upper echelons of the distribution are gaining a significant income through brand deals and advertising revenue (Oberlo, n.d.).</p>

        </h2>
        <p>This has drastically affected the lifestyle of these content creators, and in extension, the lives that their followers perceive through their portrayal on social media. Wealth is developing into a double-edged sword for SMIs as relatability turns into a declining commodity.</p>

        <p>For the younger generations specifically, Allende, Hallengren, & Berenguer (2024) observed in their study that teenagers are growing insecure due to the luxurious lives that most popular influencers lead. In terms of marketing, consumers of SMI content are also generating an awareness for these types of influencers and deciding to opt out of following them; deeming them untrustworthy. </p>

          <span id="h2-bold-italic">Growing Insecurity</span>
        </h2>
        <p>Consequently, the more paid collaborations a content creator does, the less their followers consider them to be credible and genuine (Hahl, 2023). This makes it difficult for marketers and advertisers to consistently do campaigns with top performing SMIs; on the side of the creators, it is difficult not to expect them to take more brand deals in order to garner more wealth.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-item section-2-4l l">
        <p>These issues are mitigated by AI-Driven Virtual Influencers by removing the factor of personal gain from the SMI. The artificial SMIs do not experience the pressure of needing to produce more paid collaborations, allowing for the perception of authenticity to be maintained from their audience.</p>

        <p>Granted, there is the immediate difficulty of creating a sense of genuineness from a digital machine; however, it may be counteracted by the ability to control the narrative and lifestyle of these AI models. Through deliberate planning and presentation of a humble yet interesting virtual life, followers can build a level of relatability to these SMIs and eventually grow to trust them as if they were human influencers.</p>

In the paper <span id="p-bold">"The Influence of YouTube Beauty Vloggers’ Drama on The Profit of Cosmetics Brand"</span> (Xiong, 2024), drama on content creator-driven platforms such YouTube has been found to be a major motivator for generating impressions or social capital.

      <div class="grid-item section-3-1r sec3 r">
        <p>As concluded in the previously mentioned study, a positive correlation can be observed between profits from paid collaborations and the perpetuation of tension between SMIs, based upon the greater reach and intrigue that these controversy-powered creators have over their peers.

          The limitations presented in these marketing initiatives can negatively affect both the trust and reputation of the brand as AI influencers lack the human ability to thoughtfully evaluate the products or services they promote.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is within this point that leads consumers to question the brand's credibility, establishing a disconnection among the consumers between the AI influencers and the brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The marketing campaign would then be deemed as inauthentic and solely profit-driven, further damaging the trust and credence in the brand's reputation.

          Correspondingly, the lack of transparency in AI influencers contributes to the widespread dissemination of misinformation, causing the general public to question the factuality and authenticity of the media content they post.
        </p>
        <p>
          YouGov statistics report that 75% of people in the UK have expressed concern that the rampant spread of misinformation is majorly caused by digitally altered content (Dixon, 2024).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is within this that fostered a negative public perception that AI-related initiatives, specifically AI influencer marketing, are harmful to society due to its groundless and unsubstantiated marketed material.

          The growing public distrust can lead to detrimental consequences, such as negative consumer attitudes, on both the influencers and the brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering that public reactions show 27% would engage in boycotts, primarily through blocking, unfollowing, or canceling anything associated with AI-generated content, the repercussions of AI influencer marketing pose significant risks to engagement rates and brand loyalty, leading to a much more damaging reputation for both the influencers and the brands involved (Nguyen, 2024).
